- I have to start keeping notes of what I have done and how I am going to complete the project cause now that I am seeing this, all I find is gibberish
- Tried to make sense of what I had written and what my vision was (apparently there wasn't one).
- refactored the `folderAPI` cause I read somewhere that silent error are most dangerous error and user should see something
